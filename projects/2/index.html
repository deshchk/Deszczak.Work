                        Talking to few of my friends and knowing my own needs I gathered information about necessary characteristics of the potential app and those that would be great to have.
                        Previously I've also made a <a href="https://portfolio-mkoszyk.netlify.app/" target="_blank">shopping list app</a> for me and my flatmates which provided even more insights.
                        Based on the conversations and experiences the necessary characteristics seemed to be:

                        There were some functions being described that didn't appear in everyone's statements but seemed like a great addition to the functionality of the app.
                        They are presented in the list below:

                            </li>
                            <li>

                        There have also been two use cases brought up. People list things they want to buy <b>as soon as possible</b> as well as <b>some day in the future</b>. There were also different distincions made like: buing for myself and buying for others, buying personal stuff and things for work etc.
                        It seems like there are a lot of things to be considered.

                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        There are always many ideas. Starting <b>from the big picture</b> perspective and <b>then going into details</b> seems to be working the best. That's why it is exactly what I&nbsp;did.
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="margin: 2rem 0 0">The big picture</h4>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        The project could be done as a&nbsp;<b>native mobile application</b> which would probably give the best outcomes but I&nbsp;haven't learned any native JS frameworks nor mobile languages yet.
                        I&nbsp;could learn... but maybe another time. Even if I&nbsp;coded the app it would not be easy for me to publish and use it right away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        I can write <b>websites</b> so maybe I&nbsp;could code one... BUT I&nbsp;think nobody including me would want to open a browser and input the link or click on a&nbsp;bookmark every time. <b>Not to use a&nbsp;shopping list app.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        Coding a&nbsp;<strong>Progressive Web Application</strong> (PWA) isn't much different from writing a&nbsp;website though and I&nbsp;already have some experience doing that.
                        It would not be as good as a&nbsp;native application especially when it comes to the installation process, but it'd still be better than a&nbsp;website. And most importantly ‚Äì <b>at least I'd want to use it!</b>
                    </p>

                    <h4 style="margin: 2rem 0 0">The in-between</h4>

                                Not going too far from the wider perspective it's important to assess <b>what kind of Javascript would be the best fit for the challenge</b>.
                                Vanilla, Alpine and Svelte are my top 3 in terms of what I know and can use. I love using <b>Svelte</b> and it's still the one I used the least so it comes to my mind as the first and I'd happily make a full project using it to also learn more!
                            </p>
                            <p class="project-section-p" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                                Taking into consideration the situation I'm in career-wise I think it would be better for me to use <b>vanilla JavaScript</b> though.
                                I already have a mostly Alpine.js oriented project to showcase. Making one in Svelte could be seen as good but probably more like 5 years from now.
                                It's still rarely used in production as the majority of projects use React, Vue or even Angular. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="project-section-p" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                                Job requirements for Junior Frontend Devs call for good or even exelent knowledge of JS or the aforementioned frameworks but not others.
                                Even though they all are JavaScript, in the end each of them works very differently, so it's understandable why great knowledge of vanilla JS is more valuable. 
                                Because of it I think that delivering a <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong> project should be my priority for better chances at further career development. 
                            </p>

                                As you can <span class="bracket">(or can't)</span> see on the picture above I've planned to divide the app into two lists based on the gathered insights.
                                One would be for the items needed <b>as soon as possible</b> and other for those planned to be bought <b>some day</b>. 
                                You'd be able to switch between the lists like you switch between tabs in Safari on iOS ‚Äì by swiping <span class="bracket">(more on changing my mind later)</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p class="project-section-p">
                                Items could be <b>pinned</b> to top <span class="bracket">(I might add this functionality later, for now the available filtering options seem to be good enough)</span>.
                                There was also no tags function, but a place to write <b>"where"</b> a particulat item is planned to be bought. Later it came to me that <b>tags</b> could easily replace this idea simultaneously broadening app's functionality.
                                I also thought items would be small pills in a grid/flexbox container with only their names visible <span class="bracket">(not a wise idea)</span>, but in a second I've changed my mind remembering previous experiences <span class="bracket">(oof!)</span>.
                                It seemed like a great idea to be able to add item's <b>price</b> as well, but description already allowed that and it's not often that we know how much exactly a thing will cost.
                                One last idea was being able to add <b>icons</b> to items for easier recognition but don't we already have emojis that can do exactly that and we're used to using them? Yeah.
                            </p>
                            <p class="project-section-p">
                                While coding and using the app I came up with some new ideas myself and my beta testers helped with that ideation as well. But for now I will answer...

<!-- THE OBSTACLES ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì MIDDLE -->

                        What are the obstacles?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        Looking at the plan above the only big obstacle might be related to <b>the app's design</b>. It should be easy and enjoyable to use. But how to achieve that?
                        I researched other apps and found their assets, similarities, consistencies between them to use in my own design but also noticed that my idea of a shopping list is somewhat different than all of them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        I decide to go with the <b>insights</b> I gathered. Because of the small and somewhat biased sample it's hard to know what the design should be.
                        I could gain from <b>usability tests</b> which I'll consider but the best evaluation of the design would probably be achieved by letting people use the it in the real world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        Some of us shop every day so there are many opportunities to "test" the app and tell later what are its <b>shortcomings and advantages</b>.
                        I'll depend on the <b>feedback</b> and later possibly do more <b>UX research</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-section-p">
                        None of the development part should be a problem. The project in it's necessry functionality seems to be an easy one so I don't expect any obstacles to occur.
                        I'd like to make the <b>installation process</b> better than it is by default. This might be somewhat difficult as I've never before worked with PWA's installation JS events.
                        I'm sure I'll learn and do it even if not for the first deployment :)
